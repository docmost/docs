# Introduction

Welcome to **Docmost**, an open-source collaborative wiki and documentation software.  
Designed for seamless real-time collaboration, multiple users can work on the same page at the same time in real-time without overwriting each other.

Docmost is an open-source alternative to the likes of Notion and Confluence. Whether you're managing a wiki, a knowledge base, or extensive project documentation, Docmost provides the tools you need to create, collaborate, and share knowledge effortlessly.

Docmost has support for Spaces. You can create Spaces for different teams, projects, or departments depending on your needs. Each Space comes with its own permissions.

The rich text editor has support for markdown shortcuts.

## Workspaces, spaces, and pages

In Docmost, a **_workspace_** is the top-level entity for organizing your documentation and collaboration efforts. It includes all your content, user roles, and permissions. 

Within a workspace, you can create multiple **_spaces_**. Spaces are dedicated, organized areas within your workspace that group together pages, documents, permissions, and members by project, team, or purpose.  

Within a space, you can create and manage individual documents, or **_pages_**, which contain the content itself.

### Example: Workspaces, spaces, and pages

For example, you want to create a wiki that holds content related to your organization, divided by departments. 

Here's what you do:

* Create a **_workspace_** and call it the name of your organization, such as **Acme Corp**. 
* Within your workspace, create a **_space_** for each department, such as **HR**, **R&D**, and **Finance**. 
* Within each space, create **_pages_** related to the activities in the department, such as **Annual Goals**, **Dev Roadmap**, and **Planning & Analysis**.
