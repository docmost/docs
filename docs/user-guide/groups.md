# Groups

Groups are a way to manage user permissions collectively. Instead of assigning roles and privileges to individual users, you can assign them to a group, simplifying access control across your workspace.  

There is a default group called **Everyone**. All users are automatically part of this group.

### Who Can Manage Groups?

Only users with **Admin** or **Owner** roles can create, edit, or delete groups and manage group memberships.

### Creating a Group

1. Go to **Workspace Settings**.
2. Click on **Groups** in the sidebar.
3. Click the **Create Group** button at the top right.
4. In the popup:
    - Enter a **Group Name** (e.g., `Sales`).
    - Add an optional **Description**.
    - Use the **search box** to find and add members (You can always add more members later).
5. Click **Create** to finish.
6. You’ll be redirected to the new group’s page to review or manage its members.

### Grant Group access to a Space

A **Space** is a dedicated area within your workspace for organizing pages, and collaboration. It helps teams separate content by project or department. Learn more in the [Spaces Documentation](./spaces).

After creating a group, you may want to grant it access to specific Spaces. Doing so allows all group members to inherit access to that Space with a unified role.

1. Navigate to the **Space** you want to manage.
2. Click on **Space Settings**.
3. Go to the **Members** tab.
4. Click **Add Space Members**.
5. In the popup:
    - Search for the group name.
    - Select a permission level:
        - **Full Access** – full admin control within the space
        - **Can Edit** – can edit pages and content
        - **Can View** – read-only access
    - Click **Add** to confirm.

The group will now appear in the Space members list with the assigned permission level.
> **Note:** If a user has multiple paths of access to a Space (e.g., both individually and through a group), the **highest permission level** will apply.


### Adding Members to a Group

2. Select the group.

### Editing a Group

2. Select the group.
3. Click the **three dots (⋯)** in the top right.
4. Choose **Edit Group**.
5. Update the group name and/or description.
6. Save your changes.
