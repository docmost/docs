There are several ways to open the search dialog:

## Searching for Content

## Filters

You can narrow your search results using two filters below the search field:

### Space Filter

Click the **Space** dropdown to choose where to search:

- **All spaces** — Search across all spaces you have access to.
- **Specific space** — Limit results to a single space. By default, this is set to the space you are currently viewing.

The dropdown includes a **Find a space** search field to quickly locate the space you need.

### Type Filter

Click the **Type** dropdown to filter by content type:

- **Pages** — Search page titles and content.

3. Click the **Ask** button or press Enter.
4. The AI processes your question and returns an answer based on the content in your workspace.
