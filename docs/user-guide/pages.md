# Pages

Pages are the core content units in Docmost. Each page lives within a space and supports rich text editing, nested sub-pages, comments, version history, and more.

## Creating a Page

To create a new page:

1. In the sidebar, click **New page** or click the **+** icon next to the **Pages** header.
2. A new untitled page will open in the editor.
3. Click the title area to give your page a name.
4. Start writing in the body area. Type `/` to access slash commands.

### Creating a Sub-page

Pages can be nested to create a hierarchy. To create a sub-page:

1. Hover over a page in the sidebar to reveal a **+** icon.
2. Click the **+** icon to create a child page under the selected page.

You can also drag and drop pages in the sidebar to rearrange or nest them under other pages.

## Page Toolbar

At the top of every page you will find:

- **Edit / Read** toggle - Switch between editing and read-only mode.
- **Share** - Manage public sharing settings for the page (when enabled at the workspace level).
- **Comments** - Open the comments panel to view, add, or resolve comments.
- **Table of contents** - Open the table of contents sidebar, auto-generated from headings.
- **Page menu (...)** - Access additional page actions.

## Page Menu

Click the **three-dot menu (...)** at the top right of a page to access:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Copy link** | Copy the page URL to your clipboard |
| **Copy as Markdown** | Copy the page content as Markdown text |
| **Full width** | Toggle full-width layout for the page |

The menu footer also displays the **word count**, **creator name**, and **creation date**.

Comments appear in the comments panel on the right side of the page. The panel has two tabs:

Multi-page exports are packaged as a ZIP file with a folder structure matching the page hierarchy.
