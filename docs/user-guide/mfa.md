# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a verification code in addition to your password when signing in.

:::note
MFA is an enterprise feature. An active enterprise license is required.
:::

## Supported Methods

Docmost supports **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)** for multi-factor authentication. TOTP works with authenticator apps such as:

- Google Authenticator
- Authy
- Microsoft Authenticator
- 1Password
- Any TOTP-compatible app

## Setting Up MFA

1. Go to **Settings** > **Profile**.
2. Under **2-step verification**, click **Add 2FA method**.
3. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app, or enter the setup key manually.
4. Enter the verification code generated by your authenticator app to confirm setup.

Once enabled, you will be required to enter a TOTP code from your authenticator app each time you sign in.

## Disabling MFA

To disable multi-factor authentication:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Profile**.
2. Under **2-step verification**, remove your configured 2FA method.

:::warning
Disabling MFA reduces the security of your account. Only disable it if you have a reason to do so.
