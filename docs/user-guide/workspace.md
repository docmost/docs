# Workspace
In **Docmost**, a **workspace** serves as the primary container for organizing your documentation and collaboration efforts. It encompasses all your content, user roles, and permissions. Within a workspace, you can create multiple **spaces** to categorize and manage information related to different teams, projects, or departments.

### Workspace Structure

- **Workspace**: The top-level entity that houses all your documentation.
- **Spaces**: Subdivisions within a workspace, each dedicated to a specific team, project, or department.
- **Pages**: Individual documents residing within spaces.

> This hierarchical structure — `Workspace → Space → Page` — facilitates organized and efficient content management.

### User Roles and Permissions

Within a workspace, users can be assigned different roles:

- **Owner**: Has full administrative control over the workspace.
- **Admin**: Can manage spaces and users within the workspace.
- **Member**: Has access to assigned spaces and can contribute content based on permissions.

Each space within the workspace can define its own set of permissions:

- **Full Access**: Can manage the space, including adding or removing members and editing content.
- **Can Edit**: Can modify content within the space but cannot manage members.
- **Can View**: Read-only access to the space's content.
