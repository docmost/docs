# Preferences

Each user can customize their Docmost experience through the Preferences page. To access your preferences, go to **Settings** > **Preferences**.

## Theme

Choose your preferred color scheme for the interface.

- **Light** — Light background with dark text.
- **Dark** — Dark background with light text.
- **System settings** — Automatically follow your operating system's theme preference.

## Language

Choose your preferred interface language. Docmost supports multiple languages. Select a language from the dropdown to switch the interface.

## Full Page Width

Toggle this option to expand pages to the full width of the browser window. When disabled, pages are displayed with a centered, narrower content width for improved readability.

This setting can also be toggled per page from the page menu (**...**) using the **Full width** option.

## Default Page Edit Mode

Choose the default mode when opening a page:

- **Edit** — Pages open in edit mode, ready for changes.
- **Read** — Pages open in read-only mode. This helps avoid accidental edits. You can switch to edit mode from the page toolbar when needed.
