# Configuration

## Email
To send emails, you will have to configure the email driver. This is necessary for inviting new users to your workspace.  
Docmost supports both SMTP and Postmark email drivers.

#### Using SMTP
```shell
MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USERNAME=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
SMTP_SECURE=
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=hello@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Docmost
```

### Using Postmark:
```shell
MAIL_DRIVER=postmark
POSTMARK_TOKEN=
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=hello@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Docmost
```

## File Storage
Docmost supports both local storage and S3-compatible storage drivers. The default driver is `local storage`.


### Using S3-Compatible Storage 
If you wish to use an S3-compatible storage, you have to add the below environment variables:

```shell
STORAGE_DRIVER=s3
AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_S3_REGION=
AWS_S3_BUCKET=
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=
AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=
```

Being S3-compatible means Docmost can work with AWS S3, Backblaze, Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, Minio, and other S3-compatible providers.

Refer to the [Environment Variables](/self-hosting/environment-variables) to see all available environment variables.
