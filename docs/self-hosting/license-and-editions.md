# License & Editions

Docmost is available in two editions for self-hosted deployments: **Open Source** and **Enterprise**.
They both allow self-hosting and on-premises deployment.

## Editions

### Open Source

The open source edition is free to use and includes all core documentation and collaboration features. It is available under the AGPL-3.0 license.

### Enterprise

The enterprise edition includes everything in the open source edition, plus additional features designed for larger teams and organizations.
You need an enterprise license key to unlock enterprise features.

## Managing Your License

After activating a license, the License & Edition page shows:

- **Workspace ID** — Your unique workspace identifier.
- **Member count** — The current number of members in your workspace.
- **Edition** — The active edition (Open Source or Enterprise).
- **Licensed to** — The name associated with the license.
- **Seat count** — The total licensed seats and how many are currently used.
- **Issued at** — The date the license was issued.
- **Expires at** — The license expiry date.
- **License ID** — The unique license identifier.
- **Status** — The current license status (e.g., Valid).

You can **Update license** to replace the current key with a new one, or **Remove license** to revert to the open source edition.

## License Keys and Renewal

License keys are validated offline and do not require an internet connection. When your license is up for renewal, you will receive a new license key. To apply it:

1. Go to **Settings** > **License & Edition**.
2. Click **Update license**.
3. Paste the new license key.
4. Click **Save**.

The new key replaces the previous one and the updated license details are displayed immediately.

## License Expiry

When an enterprise license expires:

- Enterprise-only features become unavailable.
- All user accounts and content remain intact.
- The workspace reverts to the open source edition.
- You can continue using Docmost with the open source feature set.

To restore enterprise features, renew your license and apply the new key via **Update license**.
